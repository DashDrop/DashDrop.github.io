I am a second year Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa. I feel lucky to be in such a fast-paced and 
hands-on program where I'm constantly learning about new ways to tackle problems in the programming realm. Besides coding, I 
like to play soccer, listen to music and read on my free time.
